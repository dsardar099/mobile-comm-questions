# Q4. Explain- 'IP-Telephony must be compatible with PSTN'

IP-Telephony refers to the delivery of voice and multimedia communications over the internet protocol (IP) network.

The statement "IP-Telephony must be compatible with PSTN" means that the IP-Telephony system must be able to communicate with and connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) which is the traditional circuit-switched telephone network used for voice communication.

This compatibility is important because PSTN still serves as the main communication network in many parts of the world and many users still rely on PSTN for their voice communication needs. As a result, IP-Telephony must be able to seamlessly integrate with PSTN to allow users to make and receive voice calls to and from PSTN users.

In summary, the compatibility between IP-Telephony and PSTN ensures that users can communicate with both IP and PSTN networks, allowing for a seamless and unified communication experience.

# Q5. Mention class ranges and default subnet values of different IPv4 classes.

IPv4 classes are a way of categorizing IP addresses based on the first octet (first 8 bits) of the address. There are five different classes of IPv4 addresses: A, B, C, D, and E. Here's a summary of the class ranges and default subnet values:

1. **Class A:**
    * Address range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
    * Default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
    * Number of network addresses: 126 (1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0)

2. **Class B:**
    * Address range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
    * Default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
    * Number of network addresses: 16,384 (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0)

3. **Class C:**
    * Address range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
    * Default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
    * Number of network addresses: 2,097,152 (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0)

4. **Class D:**
    * Address range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
    * Default subnet mask: Not applicable
    * Used for multicast IP addresses

5. **Class E:**
    * Address range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254
    * Default subnet mask: Not applicable
    * Used for experimental and future use.

In summary, different classes of IPv4 addresses are used to categorize IP addresses and each class has a different address range and default subnet value. Classes A, B, and C are used for general IP addressing while classes D and E are used for specific purposes.

# Q6. What do you mean by TCP header segment?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) header segment is a specific portion of a TCP packet that contains important information about the data being transmitted. The TCP header is added to the data being transmitted to create a TCP segment.

The TCP header segment consists of various fields that provide information about the data being transmitted such as the source and destination port numbers, sequence and acknowledgment numbers, checksum, and control flags (e.g. SYN, ACK, FIN, RST).

This information is used by TCP to provide reliable, ordered transmission of data over the network. The receiving device uses the information in the TCP header segment to reassemble the data into its original form, and to ensure that all the data is received correctly.

In summary, the TCP header segment is a crucial part of the TCP packet that contains information about the data being transmitted, which is used by TCP to provide reliable and ordered transmission of data over the network.

# Q7. Explain mechanism of RSA with example.

The RSA algorithm is a widely used public-key encryption system for secure data transmission. It was invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977.

The mechanism of RSA can be explained as follows:

Key Generation: The first step in the RSA algorithm is to generate two large prime numbers, p and q, and compute their product n = pq. A public key e is also generated such that e is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1).

Encryption: To encrypt a message, the sender converts the message into a number m and then computes the encrypted message, c = m^e (mod n). The encrypted message c is sent to the recipient.

Decryption: To decrypt the message, the recipient uses their private key, d, to compute the original message m = c^d (mod n). The private key d is generated such that d = e^-1 (mod (p-1)(q-1)).

Let's take an example to explain the mechanism of RSA:

Suppose p = 61 and q = 53, then n = pq = 61 * 53 = 3233.

Next, let's choose e = 17 as the public key, which is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1) = (60)(52) = 3120.

The private key, d, is then computed such that d = e^-1 (mod (p-1)(q-1)) = 2753.

Suppose the message to be encrypted is m = 65. The encrypted message, c, is then computed as c = m^e (mod n) = 65^17 (mod 3233) = 2790.

The recipient can then use their private key, d, to decrypt the message: m = c^d (mod n) = 2790^2753 (mod 3233) = 65.

In this way, the RSA algorithm allows for secure data transmission by converting a message into an encrypted message that can only be decrypted by the recipient with their private key.

# Q8. Explain different types of cryptographic keys.
Cryptographic keys are critical components of cryptography, used for encrypting and decrypting messages to ensure secure communication. There are several types of cryptographic keys, including:

Symmetric Key: Symmetric key cryptography, also known as shared key cryptography, uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This means that the same key is used to encrypt the message and the recipient uses the same key to decrypt the message.

Asymmetric Key: Asymmetric key cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses two different keys for encryption and decryption. A public key is used for encryption and a private key is used for decryption. This allows for secure communication as the private key is kept confidential and only used for decryption.

Public Key: The public key is part of an asymmetric key pair and is used for encrypting messages. It is freely available to anyone who wants to send an encrypted message.

Private Key: The private key is part of an asymmetric key pair and is used for decrypting messages. It must be kept confidential and secure, as it is the only key that can decrypt messages encrypted with the public key.

Session Key: A session key is a temporary symmetric key generated for a single session of communication. The session key is used to encrypt the data and is discarded after the session is completed.

In summary, there are several types of cryptographic keys, including symmetric key, asymmetric key, public key, private key, and session key. The choice of key type depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired level of security.

# Q9. What is SIM number? Explain it's components.

A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) number is a unique identification number that is assigned to every mobile phone subscriber and stored on a SIM card. A SIM card is a small removable card that is inserted into a mobile phone, tablet or modem to allow it to connect to a mobile network.

The components of a SIM number are:

ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier): The ICCID is a unique 19 or 20-digit number that identifies the SIM card itself.

IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity): The IMSI is a unique 15-digit number that identifies the subscriber. It is used by the network to authenticate the subscriber and to determine the type of service the subscriber is authorized to receive.

Ki (Authentication Key): The Ki is a secret key that is used for authentication purposes and is unique to each subscriber.

SIM Card Serial Number (SNR): The SNR is a unique number that is assigned to the SIM card at the time of manufacture. It is used to identify the SIM card and to track inventory.

In summary, the SIM number is composed of several components including the ICCID, IMSI, Ki, and SNR. These components play important roles in the functioning of the SIM card and the mobile network.

In summary, a mobile phone is composed of several components, including an antenna, RF unit, baseband processor, processor, memory, display, input devices, battery, and charging circuit. These components work together to provide the user with a mobile device that can communicate with the network and run applications.

# Q12. What is Handoff? Explain it's types.

Handoff refers to the process of transferring an active communication session from one network connection to another, without any interruption or loss of data. This is an important feature in mobile networks, as it allows a mobile device to maintain an active communication session as the user moves from one network coverage area to another.

There are two types of handoff in mobile networks:

1. **Hard Handoff:** This is a type of handoff that occurs when a mobile device disconnects from one network before connecting to another network. This results in a brief interruption in the communication session as the mobile device switches from one network to another.

2. **Soft Handoff:** This is a type of handoff that occurs when a mobile device establishes a connection with the new network before disconnecting from the old network. This results in a seamless transfer of the communication session from one network to another, without any interruption in the session.

In summary, handoff is a process of transferring an active communication session from one network connection to another. There are two types of handoff, hard handoff, and soft handoff, with soft handoff being the preferred method as it results in a seamless transfer of the communication session without any interruption.

# Q13. Define the functionality of BTS, BSC, TMSC, HLR, VLR, MSC, GMSC.

1. Base Transceiver Station (BTS): BTS is the radio equipment that provides radio coverage to the mobile devices within a cell. The BTS communicates with the mobile devices through the radio interface and with the Base Station Controller (BSC) through the backhaul link.

2. Base Station Controller (BSC): BSC is the network component that manages and controls multiple BTSs. It is responsible for allocating radio resources, managing the handoff process, and performing call setup and routing.

3. Temporary Mobile Services Switching Center (TMSC): TMSC is a temporary switching center used during the handoff process. It provides a seamless transfer of the communication session from one network to another by maintaining a connection with both the old and new networks during the handoff process.

4. Home Location Register (HLR): HLR is a central database that stores subscriber information and service profile data for each mobile subscriber. The HLR is responsible for routing incoming calls to the correct Mobile Services Switching Center (MSC) and providing the necessary subscriber information to the MSC.

5. Visitor Location Register (VLR): VLR is a database that stores subscriber information and service profile data for each mobile subscriber that is currently located in a different MSC from the HLR. The VLR provides the necessary subscriber information to the MSC for incoming and outgoing calls.

6. Mobile Services Switching Center (MSC): MSC is the network component that provides switching and routing functions for the mobile network. It is responsible for managing incoming and outgoing calls and providing mobility management services, such as handoff and roaming.

7. Global Mobile Services Switching Center (GMSC): GMSC is a central component that acts as a gateway between the mobile network and the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The GMSC is responsible for routing incoming and outgoing calls to and from the PSTN.

# Q14. Difference between connection oriented(TCP) and connection less(UDP) protocol.

| **Connection-Oriented (TCP)**                                              | **Connectionless (UDP)**                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reliable                                                                   | Unreliable                                                                        |
| Sequenced delivery of data                                                 | Unsequenced delivery of data                                                      |
| Slower due to reliability mechanisms                                       | Faster due to lack of reliability mechanisms                                      |
| Establishes a connection before data transfer                              | No connection establishment                                                       |
| Appropriate for applications that require reliability and ordered delivery | Appropriate for applications that do not require reliability and ordered delivery |
| Examples: FTP, HTTP, Telnet                                                | Examples: DNS, DHCP, streaming media                                              |

In summary, the main difference between TCP and UDP is the reliability of the communication. TCP provides a reliable, ordered delivery of data, while UDP is an unreliable, unordered delivery of data. The choice between the two protocols depends on the requirements of the specific application.

# Q16. What do you mean by ICMP and IGMP?

ICMP and IGMP are two important protocols in computer networking.

1. **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):** ICMP is a network-layer protocol that is used to send error messages, control messages, and status messages between network devices. It is used by routers and other network devices to report error conditions and to provide information about network conditions. Examples of ICMP messages include "ping" and "traceroute".

2. **Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP):** IGMP is a network-layer protocol that is used by routers and hosts to manage multicast group memberships. It allows a host to join or leave a multicast group and enables routers to learn which hosts belong to which multicast groups. This information is used by routers to forward multicast traffic only to the members of the specific multicast group.

In summary, ICMP is used for error and status messages, while IGMP is used for managing multicast group memberships. Both protocols are important for the smooth operation of computer networks.

# Q17. Compare FDMA and CDMA.

# Q20. what is cell number(Honey Bee model)?

In a cellular network, the "cell number" is a unique identifier assigned to each cell in the network. It is used to distinguish one cell from another and to route calls and data to the correct cell.

The "Honey Bee" model refers to a cellular network architecture where cells are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, similar to the pattern of honeycomb in a beehive. This model is used to visualize the relationship between cells and their neighboring cells, and is often used to demonstrate the basic principles of a cellular network.

In this model, each cell is assigned a unique cell number and the network is divided into multiple sectors to increase capacity. When a mobile device moves from one cell to another, the network uses the cell number to track the device and to ensure that calls and data are smoothly handed over from one cell to another.

# Q21. What is the Principle of reusability in mobile communication?

The principle of reusability in mobile communication refers to the ability to use a single physical resource multiple times to provide service to different users. This is achieved by dividing the resource into smaller logical units, each of which can be assigned to different users as needed. The concept of reusability is a key factor in optimizing the use of limited resources in mobile communication systems, such as spectrum and network capacity.

For example, in cellular networks, the spectrum is divided into smaller frequency bands, each of which can be assigned to different cells and users. This allows for multiple users to share the same physical resource (the frequency band) and provides a more efficient use of the available spectrum. Similarly, network resources, such as cell towers and transmission links, can be shared by multiple cells to provide coverage to a larger geographic area.

The principle of reusability is a key driver for the development of new technologies in mobile communication, such as 5G and beyond, which aim to increase the number of users that can be served by a single resource. By maximizing the reusability of resources, mobile communication systems can achieve higher capacity, higher efficiency, and lower costs.

# Q22. What is the Principle of frequency of reuse in mobile communication?

The principle of frequency reuse in mobile communication refers to the use of the same frequency band by multiple cells in a cellular network. By carefully designing the network, the frequency band can be reused in different cells, allowing for more efficient use of limited spectrum resources. The idea behind frequency reuse is to minimize the interference between cells, so that the same frequency band can be used multiple times in different cells without causing significant interference.

In a cellular network, cells are grouped into clusters, and the frequency band is reused within each cluster. The distance between cells using the same frequency band is determined by the frequency reuse factor. The frequency reuse factor is typically set to 7, which means that cells using the same frequency band are separated by a minimum of 7 cells. This provides enough separation between cells to minimize interference and to allow for efficient use of the frequency band.

The principle of frequency reuse is a key factor in optimizing the use of limited spectrum resources in cellular networks. By reusing the same frequency band multiple times, a cellular network can provide coverage to a larger geographic area with the same amount of spectrum. This results in higher capacity, higher efficiency, and lower costs for the network.

# Q23. What is the optimum number of mobile cells?

**(Ans-6)**
The optimum number of mobile cells in a cellular network depends on several factors, including the desired coverage area, the available spectrum, the traffic demand, the type of services offered, and the technology used.

In general, the optimum number of cells is determined by a trade-off between the need for coverage and the need for capacity. A smaller number of cells provides wider coverage but lower capacity, while a larger number of cells provides higher capacity but more limited coverage.

In practice, the optimum number of cells can vary greatly depending on the specific requirements of the network. For example, in a dense urban environment with high traffic demand, a larger number of smaller cells may be required to provide the necessary capacity. In a rural area with lower traffic demand, a smaller number of larger cells may be sufficient to provide coverage.

The optimum number of cells also depends on the technology used, as different technologies have different capacity and coverage characteristics. For example, with the advancement of 5G technology, it is possible to have smaller cells with higher capacity, which can be used to achieve higher density and better coverage in urban areas.

In summary, the optimum number of cells in a cellular network can vary greatly depending on the specific requirements and the technology used. There is no single answer to this question, as the optimum number of cells depends on the specific conditions and requirements of the network.

# Q24. What is plain text and cipher text?

Plain text refers to a message or data that is in its original, unencrypted form. It is the original, readable message that is meant to be transmitted or stored.

Cipher text, on the other hand, is the encrypted form of plain text, where the original message has been transformed into a coded message through the use of cryptography. Cipher text is not readable or understandable without being decrypted, and it is intended to provide confidentiality and protection of the original message.

For example, if a person wants to send a confidential message to another person, they can convert the plain text into cipher text using a cryptographic algorithm, and then send the encrypted message. The recipient can then use the same cryptographic algorithm and the decryption key to convert the cipher text back into plain text, and read the original message.

In this way, cipher text provides a means to secure the transmission or storage of sensitive information, as the encrypted message can only be decrypted by someone with the appropriate key or cryptographic algorithm.

# Q25. What do you mean by chip sequence in CDMA. Explain briefly.

In CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), a chip sequence refers to a unique code that is assigned to each user in the network to distinguish their signals from other users. The chip sequence is used to modulate the data signal before it is transmitted over the air, and it is also used to demodulate the received signal to extract the original data.

The chip sequence works by spreading the data signal over a large bandwidth, and then assigning a unique code to each user. Each user's code is orthogonal to the codes of all other users, which means that the signals can be distinguished from each other even if they are transmitted at the same time.

The chip sequence is used to modulate the data signal by multiplying the data signal with the unique code. This spreads the data signal over a large bandwidth and makes it possible to distinguish the signals from each other at the receiver. The receiver then uses the same unique code to demodulate the received signal and extract the original data.

In summary, the chip sequence is a unique code that is assigned to each user in a CDMA network to distinguish their signals from other users. It works by spreading the data signal over a large bandwidth, and using a unique code to modulate and demodulate the signals.

# Q26. Show signal strength of CDMA for 4 stations with chip sequence [+1 +1 -1 +1].

# Q27. Explain components of DHCP.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) has three main components:

DHCP Client: A device (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet) that requests an IP address from a DHCP server.

DHCP Server: A device (such as a router or network appliance) that provides IP addresses and other network configuration information to DHCP clients.

DHCP Database: A database that stores information about IP addresses that have been assigned by the DHCP server and the devices to which they have been assigned. The DHCP database is used to track the use of IP addresses and ensure that they are not assigned to multiple devices at the same time.

When a device requests an IP address, the DHCP client sends a broadcast message to the network, which is received by all devices on the network. The DHCP server responds to the request by assigning an available IP address and other network configuration information, such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. The DHCP client then stores this information in its network configuration, so that it can communicate with other devices on the network.

In summary, the components of DHCP are the DHCP client, the DHCP server, and the DHCP database. These components work together to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on the network.

# Q28. Difference between different ALOHA.

| **Pure ALOHA**           | **Slotted ALOHA**                                                         | **Hybrid ALOHA**                                                                                                                        |

| **Collision Handling**   | No collision resolution mechanism                                         | Collision resolution mechanism, but still not optimal                                                                                   | Efficient collision resolution mechanism                                                                                                                                                  |

In Pure ALOHA, there is no time synchronization between stations, so they can transmit data at any time. This leads to a high number of collisions, which results in low efficiency.

Slotted ALOHA improves on Pure ALOHA by dividing the time into discrete slots and only allowing stations to transmit data at the start of a slot. This reduces the number of collisions, but still not enough to achieve optimal efficiency.

Hybrid ALOHA combines the advantages of both Pure ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA. It allows stations to transmit data at any time, but reduces the number of collisions by using a more efficient random access mechanism. This results in higher efficiency than Pure and Slotted ALOHA.
